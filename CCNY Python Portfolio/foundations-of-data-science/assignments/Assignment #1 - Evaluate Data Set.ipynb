    "# Assignment #1: Evaluate Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "In your first graded assignment for this course, you will find and evaluate a data set on a topic of your choosing. You will be given specific questions related to the data set, and you will also be tasked with importing the data from your data set into your Jupyter Notebook environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose a Broad Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "First, choose a topic of interest to you, such as a specific social issue, a political or cultural trend, a community, or a hobby or personal interest. Ideally, it should be something relatively broad that society or culture is having some sort of conversation about, or which many people think about on a regular basis. Possible examples might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Housing and rental prices in New York City\n",
    "- A popular genre of music\n",
    "- A sport\n",
    "- Food prices\n",
    "- Crime\n",
    "- Government spending\n",
    "- Popularity of movies or TV shows \n",
    "- Bestselling books\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find a Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for terms related to your topic on Google, both generally and by adding specific names of websites where data will commonly be found. The following websites are frequently places to find data sets, and it sometimes makes sense to both search directly on the site and to do regular Google searches with the site name:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Google Data Set Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)\n",
    "- [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n",
    "- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your topic is bestselling books, you might try these searches on Google:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bestselling books data set\n",
    "- bestselling books data set kaggle\n",
    "- bestselling books data set github\n",
    "- bestselling books data set \n",
    "\n",
    "You're not likely to find bestselling books data on data.gov, but you might find a lot of info related to health, the economy, and demographics, since that's what the government is most concerned about."

    "Because of the role of the U.S. in global affairs, the amount of questions that this data set could answer are many. How much money does the U.S. provide in economic or military assistance? Which countries receive more military assistance? Does U.S. military/economic assistance trend more towards one country or region in the world? Has economic or military assistance increased over the years? Are there years in which military or economic assistance dipped or spiked? Has the way assistance is allocated shifted between departments? The data set can't provide reasons as to why changes have occured alone, but when examining the data, it can be easier to view historical trends and make inferences as to why spending changed. For example, in my paper about Libya, it would be fascinating to see how U.S. assistance changed through the political developments in the country (like the coup in 1969 for example, or the murder of Qaddafi in 2011). Did the U.S. previously provide military or economic aid that stopped, decreased, or increased after the 1969 revolution? Did the aid increase, start, stop, or decrease in 2011? This could be quite valuable for analysing the role of U.S. economic and military aid in the world or in a particular country. "

    "The first thing I noticed was that Yemen is combined into one country even during the years that it was split in two (1967-1991). This would make more insightful analysis on U.S. assistance to South Yemen during these years particularly difficult without more details (which are not included in the dataset). I assume this is true of more countries which either have had competing governments or were not consistent with the state they are in now. Additionally, some of the historical data is not complete. The publication row and funding agency columns are missing some of the data, instead filling it with \"unknown\" or \"inactive programs\". I wish they had done more research to determine the funding agencies as I'm almost certain there are documents that would reveal this. I also wish they had listed the inactive programs instead of just listing \"inactive programs\", because it might still be relevant to see what programs the funding was listed under to determine the role of those programs at the time. Additionally, it is missing the greater context of world history so the data can't be necessarily connected to broader trends, though this is a limitation of many/most datasets. "
